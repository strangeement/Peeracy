# Peeracy README

Peeracy is a platform for dynamic mass communication and decision-making based on a direct process capable of reaching scalable consensus based on tiered quora. It is capable of creating and passing laws, electing public officers and establishing constitutional consensus.

The core aspect of peeracy is a process that actively seeks areas of broad consensus and submits them to an increasingly large circle of peers. It finds what unites us in order to make rules that we universally agree on. It accomplishes that additionally by making it possible to find the wise, competent and well-meaning leaders that we deserve.


There are 3 aspects:

Communication
Officeholding
Process

The main part is how peeracy functions as a communication platform. Peeracy is a system of communication that allows millions of people to have meaningful discussions that are capable of providing decision-making. 

It works as a platform of directed discussion through a system of peers. Every peer can submit a statement. This statement is then sent to a circle of peers, the number of which depends on the scope of the statement or the influence of a public office. The statement must be discussed by the peers and a consensus must rise, same as how juries pass judgment.

For practical purposes, consensus should be defined as an approval of 90%, with a minimum quorum of 50% of the peer population.

The heuristic serves to identify the points of legislation that have consensus. Instead of tackling problems directly, we try to find legislation that finds consensus. The proposed outcome is that doing so will make most of the problems that donâ€™t have consensus to be resolved by handling root causes that amplify them.
